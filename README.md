# NoRTune
We introduce NoRTune, a resource-efficient and reliable configuration tuning framework for Spark that leverages subspace-based Bayesian optimization and a noise-robust acquisition function. NoRTune optimizes Spark configuration by effectively reducing high-dimensional parameters without requiring time-consuming and resource-intensive determination of the target dimensionality. Moreover, it is able to select an optimal configuration with reliable performance by reducing the impact of noise.
